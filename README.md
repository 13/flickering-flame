# flickering-flame
Simple flickering flame effect class for Arduino

Control one or more LEDs using analogWrite() on any Arduino. The LED changes brightness randomly. That alone would not look much like a flame but a simple exponential low pass filter enhances the effect greatly.

Set up an array of several LEDs and you get a fire effect. Choose a combination of yellow and RED LEDs to suit or white and red LEDs with a coloured diffuser.

You can see a crude demonstration at https://youtu.be/DHceQaXWeAw. Here four white LEDs and one red LED are placed in a row and then covered with a cut up yellow party balloon. It looks better than it sounds.
